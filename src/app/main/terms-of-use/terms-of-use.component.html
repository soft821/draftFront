            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
            <p>You and DraftMatch agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the DraftMatch Service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and DraftMatch are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Agreements, and as administered by the AAA. You and DraftMatch agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by DraftMatch. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed “excessive” will be paid by DraftMatch.</p>
